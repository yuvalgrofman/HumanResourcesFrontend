Please create a React component called CompleteUnitCard. 
The Component receives two JSON objects of the following form:

unitData = {
    "R1" : integer,
    "R2" : integer,
    "R3+" : integer,
    "Total" : integer,
}

1. The two JSON object are called currentAmount and lastAmount. They represnent the amount 
of the resources of each parameter, at the current and last time, respectively.

2. Minimum Value - The minimum value that can appear of some resource (Default is 0).
3. Maximum Value - The maximum value that can appear of some resource (Default is 50).
4. Growth Type - The growth type of the resource, the possible values are:
    - "Increase" - The resource is increasing.
    - "Decrease" - The resource is decreasing.
    - "Stable" - The resource is stable.

Using this information, the component uses the RightUnitCard to create a complete unit card.
Please implement the component according to the following components:
1. The components left side, should contains the following information:
    - The name of the unit.
    - The current total amount of the resource.
    - The growth type of the resource.
2. The name of the unit should be displayed in a large font, bold and be the first element in the left side.
2. The current total amount should be the second element in the left side.
3. Below the current total amount, the growth type should be displayed as follows:
    - If the growth type is "Increase", there should be an icon which shows a linear increase in time.
    The icon should be simple, clean and easy to understand.
    - If the growth type is "Decrease", there should be an icon which shows a linear decrease in time.
    - If the growth type is "Stable", the icon should show a stable line.
4. The color of the background of the left side should be as follows:
    - If the current total amount is greater than the last total amount, should be a shade of growthColor, 
    where the color should be darker as the current total amount is greater than the last total amount.
    - If the current total amount is less than the last total amount, should be a shade of declineColor, 
    where the color should be darker as the current total amount is less than the last total amount.
    - If the current total amount is equal to the last total amount, the background color should be white.
5. The part I have described above represnets the left side of the component.
The left side should be sticked to the rightUnitCard component.

To style this component, please use the given index.css file
and also create a dedicated CSS file for the RightUnitCard component.

We also give you the rightUnitCard component, to understand how to use it. 

Please do your best and thank you!

===================================================================================================================================

Update the component such that:
1. If the title is two lines, then the margins are smaller such that 
the position of the icon does not change. 

2. If the title is seven characters or more, the font size is smaller such that the title does not overflow the card.
