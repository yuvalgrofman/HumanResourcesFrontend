Consider the given orgChart.js component.
Please add a feature which allows the user to click on a node. 

The feature should be implemented as follows: 
1. The component should receive a new prop useState prop called 'clickedNodeID' which is a string.
2. When a node is clicked, the component should update the 'clickedNodeID' state with the ID of the clicked node. 

=======================================================================

Our goal now is to support the feature of clicking on a node in the orgChart component.
Thus, we updated the orgChart component such that it receives two new props:
1. clickedNodeID: a string representing the ID of the clicked node.
2. setClickedNodeID: a function to update the clickedNodeID state.

Please implement the following changes to the orgChartPage component:

1. Add a new state variable called 'clickedNodeID' using the useState hook.
2. Pass the 'clickedNodeID' and 'setClickedNodeID' props to the orgChart component.
3. When the value of the 'clickedNodeID' state changes, log the new value to the console and 
make sure to update the DataPanel component to reflect the clicked node.

For reference, the signature of the orgChart component is as follows:

const OrgChart = ({ selectedDate, pastDate, rootUnit, childUnits, parallelUnits, clickedNodeID, setClickedNodeID })
