Use the D3.js library to create an organizational chart of a military unit.
You are given the current OrgChart.js component as an example of how to use 
the various components in the project.
You goal is to re-implement the OrgChart.js component using the D3.js library.

When designing the org chart, please consider the following:
1. Make the organizational chart a tree - where each node is a unit and the children of the node are the sub-units of the unit.
2. Their should appear a line which connects the parent node to the child node.  
3. The subtrees should have the ability to be collapsed and expanded.
4. Each node should contains the name of the unit, the amoumt of regular soldiers, officers senior officers and the total amount of soldiers in the unit.
5. Please style the nodes in the chart. 
    a. Different colors for the different levels of the units. For example, the second level can have a dark green outline and 
    a light green background.   
    b. Use icons for the different levels of the units.
    c. The number of regular soldiers, officers and senior officers should be shown using icons and horizontal bars.
  
Begin by designing the node of the chart and then design the whole chart.
The design of the node should be clean, elegant and modern.



. Make units closed appear faded and choose a bright color for the opened units.
6. Add a filter feature to the chart - when a filter is applied, 
the charts makes the units which satisfy the filter appear in a bright color and the units which do not satisfy the filter appear faded. 
7. Please style the nodes in the chart. 
    a. Different colors for the different levels of the units. For example, the second level can have a dark green outline and 
    a light green background.   
    b. Use icons for the different levels of the units.
    c. The number of regular soldiers, officers and senior officers should be shown using icons and horizontal bars.
8. Make the chart vertical - The root node should be at the top. 
9. When collapsing a node, the children of the node should be removed from the chart.
10. Make sure there is a small margin between different nodes in the chart.
11. Make sure the lines in the chart are straight and not curved.
