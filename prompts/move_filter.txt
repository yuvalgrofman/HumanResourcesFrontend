Please update the ArrowChartPage.js component such that 
the Organizational Control Panel which is located on the left side of the page
also contains another input field which is called Arrow Filter. 
The Arrow Filter input field should appear right next to the Chart Depth (Levels) input field,
and it should contain a number. 
The number should change a state variable called arrowFilterValue 
which should be initialized to 0 and given to the ArrowChart component as a prop.
