Now, please implement the timeGraphPage.js component. 
The goal of the timeGraphPage is to display the total amount of personel in the different units of the organization.
To do this, it shows multiple graphs which display the total personel in each unit over time. 

The timeGraphPage component should use the following context variables from the DataContext.js file:
1. selectedDate - The modern date selected by the user.
2. pastDate - The old date selected by the user.
3. CurrentUnits - The organization structure at time selectedDate.

The timeGraphPage should be built as follows:
1. On the left there should appear a control panel similar to the one in the orgChartPage.js component.
    - It should contain a scrollable checkbox list of all the units in the organization with a search bar on top.
    Allowing the user to select multiple units.
    - There should appear a status bar at the bottom of the control panel, which shows 2 stats about the selected units:
      - The total number of selected units.
      - The total number of personnel in the selected units at the selected date.
    When making this part, take very heavy inspiration from the orgChartPage.js component.

2. On the middle-bottom of the page there should appear a slider to select the pastDate and selectedDate.
Use the same slider component as in the orgChartPage.js component.

3. In the middle of the page there should appear the main visualization. 
This visualization should display all the graphs for the selected units, on each other. 
The dates appearing on the x-axis should be between the pastDate and selectedDate.

We provide the following files to help you:
1. The current TimeGraphPage.js.
2. The DataContext.js file which provides the necessary hooks to access the organization data.
3. The Slider.js component which is used to select the dates.
4. The OrgChartPage.js component which is the parent of the OrgChart component and contains the control panel. 

Make sure:
1. Not to use the TimeGraph.js component, it is meant for a different purpose.
2. Write a new CSS file for the TimeGraphPage component, named TimeGraphPage.css, and import it in the TimeGraphPage.js component.
3. Feel free to use bootstrap to style the component, make it clean, user-friendly, responsive and elegant.
4. Do you best and thank you!
