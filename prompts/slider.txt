Please write a React component that implements a horizontal slider.
The parameters of the slider should be:

1. Minimum Year - The minimum year that is represented by the slider.
2. Maximum Year - The maximum year that is represented by the slider.
3. Step - The step value for the slider (default is 1 year).

At each moment the slider controls the following two values:

1. Selected Year - The year that is currently selected by the slider.
2. Past Year - The year to which we compare the selected year.

Thus, the slider should contain a movable thumb which has a (starting) width of 2 years. 
The thumb can move over the range of years and it changes the Past and Selected Year values accordingly.
Moreover, the slider has the following crucial feature - The thumb can be increased in width by dragging it 
left or right sides. Obviously, the width must remain a multiple of the step value.

To implement this, please also take into account and update the DataContext.js file 
such that it contains both the selected and past year values,
and that the slider is able to update them accordingly.

Finally, make sure to style the slider properly using the provided index.css file.
Please also make a dedicated CSS file for the slider component.

Now, let us discuss the styling of the slider:
1. The thumb should be a blue rectangle (use the colors from the index.css file) 
2. Below 5 steps, there should be a number which indicates the year.
3. The outline of the slider should a white rectangle which encloses the thumb.
4. Between every two steps, there should be a dotted line, make it have a subtle color.

Do your best and thank you!

Please updathe the styling of the slider component such that:

1. The slider is much taller.
2. Both the thumb and the outline of the slider should be rounded. 
3. The year number should be bigger, in bold and in the middle of the step.

======================================================================================================================================================

Please update the the styling of the slider component such that:

1. The first and last dotted lines don't appear, i.e. remove the leftmost and rightmost vertical dotted lines.
2. Only the slider handels are rounded and they are only rounded on the outside.
So, the left handle is rounded on the left side and the right handle is rounded on the right side.
On the other side the handles should be square.
