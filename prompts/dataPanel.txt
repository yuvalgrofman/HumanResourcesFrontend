Please update the dataPanel component as follows: 

It receives a new prop called 'unit' which is a JSON object representing a military unit.
It has the following structure:

unit: {
    "date": "2024-01-01", 
    "id": "BDE-INF-001",
    "name": "1st Infantry Brigade",
    "officers": 362,
    "parent_id": "DIV-001",
    "regular_soldiers": 7276,
    "senior_officers": 10,
    "total_personnel": 7648

} 

The dataPanel component should display two main graphs about the clicked node:

1. A pie chart which shows the distribution of the resources of the clicked node.
Currently, it should use the total_personnel is the total resource 
which is divided into the following categories:
- Officers,
- Senior Officers,
- Regular Soldiers. 

2. The second graph should be a time series graph which shows the total personall in the unit over time.
To do this, the component should use the getUnitTimeSeries function which is imported from the api.js file. 

The function has the following signature:
export const getUnitTimeSeries = async (unitId) => response.data; 

We provide an example of the data returned by this function:

{
  "unit_id": "DIV-001",
  "data": [
    {
      "unit_id": "DIV-001",
      "unit_name": "1st Division",
      "parent_unit_id": "HQ-001",
      "regular_soldiers": 1000,
      "officers": 80,
      "senior_officers": 10,
      "total_personnel": 1090,
      "date": "2023-05-01"
    },
    {
      "unit_id": "DIV-001",
      "unit_name": "1st Division",
      "parent_unit_id": "HQ-001",
      "regular_soldiers": 1010,
      "officers": 82,
      "senior_officers": 10,
      "total_personnel": 1102,
      "date": "2023-05-05"
    },
    {
      "unit_id": "DIV-001",
      "unit_name": "1st Division",
      "parent_unit_id": "HQ-001",
      "regular_soldiers": 1000,
      "officers": 80,
      "senior_officers": 10,
      "total_personnel": 1090,
      "date": "2023-05-10"
    }
  ]
}

Please rewrite the dataPanel component to include these two graphs, 
also make a new dedicated CSS file for the dataPanel component.
Additionally, we provide the orgChartPage component which is the parent of the dataPanel component, 
in order to help you understand how the dataPanel component is used.

Please do your best and thank you!
