Please update the innerHTML code which begins at line 940 such that:

Each node has a surrounding ellipse 
which is colored based in the difference of special soldiers in the unit. 
In particular, it is colored based on the variable specialSoldierDiff.

The function that is responsible for choosing the color already exists 
and is called getEllipseColor(specialSoldierDiff).

Your job is to update the innerHTML code such that it includes an ellipse.
