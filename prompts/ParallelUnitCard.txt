Now, please create a React component called ParallelUnitCard
which is similar to the complete unitCard component except that the left side of the component
now appears on top and the right side of the component appears on the bottom.
Please rewrite the RightUnitCard component and the CompleteUnitCard component
into one component called ParallelUnitCard. 

One change is that the icon should now appear to the right of the title.

Pleae use the index.css file to style the component
and create a dedicated css file for the component.

Do you best and thank you!
