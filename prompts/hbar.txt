Please write a React component that implements a horizontal bar.
The parameters of the bar should be:

1. Minimum Value - The minimum value that can be represented by the bar (Default is 0).
2. Maximum Value - The maximum value that is represented by the bar (Default is 50). 
3. Current Value - The current value represented by the bar (No default).
4. Last Value    - The previous value represented by the bar (No default).
5. Growth Color  - The color of the bar when the current value is greater than the last value (Default is green).
6. Decline Color - The color of the bar when the current value is less than the last value (Default is red).
7. Neutral Color - The color of the bar which doesn't represent a difference between the current and last value (Default is blue).
8. Name Of Bar   - Shows what the value of the bar represents (Default value is "R1").

The bar should be a horizontal rectangle such that:
1. There bar is dividied into two section, the equal part and the difference part.
2. The equal part is the the part up to the minimum of the current and last value, this part is colored with the neutral color.
3. The difference part is the part between the minimum of the current and last value and the maximum of the current and last value.
The color of this part is determined as follows: If the current value is greater than the last value, then the color of this part is the growth color.
Otherwise, the color of this part is the decline color.
4. There horizontal bar should contain two vertical lines.
5. The first vertical line is called the current value line and it is placed at the current value. It is a solid line which is colored black.
6. The second vertical line is called the last value line and it is placed at the last value. It is a dashed line which is colored black.

When styling the bar, please do the following:
1. Make the outline of the bar a white rectangle which encloses the bar. The outline should be black.
2. The height of the bar should be 20px.
3. The default colors used should be gentle such that the vertical lines are noticeable.

You may use the index.css file to style the bar,
but please also make a dedicated CSS file for the bar component.

Do your best and thank you!
