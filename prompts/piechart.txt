Consider the following pie chart react component.
Please make the following changes:

1. Change the position of the legend such that it appears like a card below the pie chart.

===================================================

Now, please keep restyle the pie chart but make sure it still fits with the project and specifically 
the DataPanel component which uses the pieChart. 
We provide:
1. The previous pie chart implementation as a reference.
2. The DataPanel component which uses the pieChart.

Please create both the new pie chart component, 
and a dedicated css file for the new pie chart component.

When styling the pie chart, please ensure that it is visually appealing and consistent with the overall design of the DataPanel component.
Moreover, make sure the design is elegant, modern, clean, is easy to read, and is responsive.
