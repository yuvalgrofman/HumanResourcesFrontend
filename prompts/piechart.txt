Consider the following pie chart react component.
Please make the following changes:

1. Change the position of the legend such that it appears like a card below the pie chart.

===================================================

Now, please keep the current style of the pie chart but reimplement it so that it 
fits with the project and specifically the DataPanel component which uses the pieChart. 
We provide:
1. The previous pie chart implementation as a reference.
2. The DataPanel component which uses the pieChart.

Please create both the new pie chart component, 
and a dedicated css file for the new pie chart component.
You can rewrite the dataPanel component such that it only shows the new pie chart component.
