Hello Claude, please update the block of code which begins 
in line 738, such that if a node appears in the parentNode, then 
there is a rounded rectangular box which appears 135 pixels below the node. 
The box should appear exactly where the green arrows begin and the red arrows end. 
There should be a MiniCard for each node in the parent level, even if there 
are on arrows.
