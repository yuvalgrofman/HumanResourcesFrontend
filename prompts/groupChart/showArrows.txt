Now, please update the block which begins in line 760 in as 
responsible for drawing the arrows in the chart.
Please update the arrows drawn as follows: 

1. Every node in the bottom row should have two arrows to it's parent node. 
A green arrow which points into the child node and shows the number of soldiers that were moved to the child node,
and a red arrow which points into the parent node and shows the number of soldiers that were moved. 
The arrows should appear side by side, but have reverse directions. 
The red arrow should begin in the top-middle of the child node and point to the bottom of the parent node,
where the horizontal position should depend on the horizontal position of the child node, in relation to the parent node.
The green arrow should be similar but have the opposite direction,
moreover make sure the arrows have a gap between them so they do not overlap.

2. From the paren nodes there should be arrows to other nodes in the parent row,
which have the same form as the current arrows which appear in the file.
