Hello Claude, Please update the block of code which begins in line 820, 
such that each miniCard has a connection to the parent node.
The connection should be a wide vertical line with high opacity. 
The line should remind that of a sankey diagram, 
where the width of the line is proportional to the total number of special soldiers 
entering the parent node (which can be negative if more soldiers leave than enter).
The color of the line should be red/green depending on whether the total is negative/positive.
There is no need to rewrite the whole code, just write the exact changes needed to achieve this
and write the exact line numbers where the changes should be made.
