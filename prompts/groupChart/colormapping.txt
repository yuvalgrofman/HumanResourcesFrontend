Hello Claude, please update the code such that each 
parent node is mapped to a uniqe color. Now, 
the miniCard should have a gradient coloring that is based
on the parent node's color.
Moreover, the color of each parent-to-parent arrow 
should have the same color as the destination parent node.
Only update the relevant parts of the code, 
and write exactly where to place the changes.
