Hello claude, consider the given GroupChart.js component. 
A crucial feature of the component is the fact that it can show
the movement of soldiers in the organization using arrows. 
Please update the calculateSoldierMovements function which appears in line 94 as follows:

Instead of directly showing the movement of the soldiers from one unit to another, 
we only want to show the movements of soldiers in the bottom row of the chart, 
and we want to do this using the row above the bottom row.

Thus, update the function such that there are two types of arrows:
We call the lowest row the bottom row, and the row above it the parent row.

1. Arrows from a unit in the lowest row to it's parent unit tn the parent above. 

2. Then, from the parent unit in the parent row there should be arrows 
to all other units in the parent row, which contain a unit that recieved soldiers 
from a source unit which is below the source parent.   

3. Then, there should be arrows from the destition parent to the appropriate sub-units in the bottom row.  

Please ensure that you reimplement the function correctly. 
Do you best, thank you!
