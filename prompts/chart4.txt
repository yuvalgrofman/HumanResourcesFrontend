The following is a placeholder for the OrgChart.js component.
Please implement the OrgChart.js component.

You are given the current OrgChart.js component as an example of how to use 
the various components in the project.
You goal is to re-implement the OrgChart.js component without using the D3.js library.

When designing the org chart, please consider the following:
1. Make the organizational chart a tree - where each node is a unit and the children of the node are the sub-units of the unit.
2. Their should appear a line which connects the parent node to the child node.  
3. The subtrees should have the ability to be collapsed and expanded.
4. Each node should contains the name of the unit, the amoumt of regular soldiers, officers senior officers and the total amount of soldiers in the unit.
5. Please style the nodes in the chart. 
    a. Different colors for the different levels of the units. For example, the second level can have a dark green outline and 
    a light green background.   
    b. Use icons for the different levels of the units.
    c. The number of regular soldiers, officers and senior officers should be shown using icons and horizontal bars.
  
Crucially, design the nodes as a new component in a seperate file and import it into the OrgChart.js component.
