Consider the following ChordDiagram component. 
Please tell me what part of the code is responsible for the margins between the arcs of the diagram. 
Specifically, If I want to decrease the margins between the arcs and make the arcs longer, which part of the code should I modify?
Secondly, please tell me how to make the chords between the arcs thicker, and which part of the code is responsible for that.

How can I update the Ribbons such that the width of the ribbons has less variance. 
In other words, the wide ribbons should have the same width but the narrow ribbons 
should be wider.
