Please update the block of code which begins in line 704 and is responsible for
creating the outer arcs, such that the width of an outer arc is proportional to the number of soldiers in the corresponding parent unit.
In other words, the arcs in the outer arc should not have a fixed width, instead 
the width should be larger for parents with more soldiers and smaller for parents with fewer soldiers.
