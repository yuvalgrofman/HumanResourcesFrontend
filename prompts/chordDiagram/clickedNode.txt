Please update the ChordDiagram such that when an arc is clicked, 
the clickedNodeID is set to the ID of the unit of the clicked arc.
Don't rewrite the entire component, instad, write the code that needs to be reimplemented 
and explaind exactly where to place it in the existing code (exact line numbers).
