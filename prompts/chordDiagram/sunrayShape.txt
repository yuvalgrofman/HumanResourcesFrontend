Please update the block of code which begins in line 1111 such that 
the shape of the sunray is an incoming our outgoing trapezoid, depending on whether the 
sunray is incoming or outgoing. 
In particular, if the sunray is incoming, the outer edge of the trapezoid should be larger 
while the inner edge should be smaller, and vice versa for outgoing sunrays.
