Please update the code block which begins in line 652 such that 
is uses the arrowFilterValue from the props to filter the movement arrows which 
are displayed.

In particalar, only the arrows which show the movement of more than 
arrowFilterValue soldiers should be displayed.

===========================================================

Please update the ArrowChart.js component such that, 
in addition to keeping track of the last clicked unit, which is stored with the clickedNodeId,
variable, it also keeps tracks of all the units that have been clicked. 

In particular, add a new state variable called clickedNodeIds, which is an array that stores the ids of all clicked units.

When a unit is clicked, its id should be added to the clickedNodeIds array,
when it is clicked again, it should be removed from the array.

Please update the borderColoe code in line 950 such that Orane Border is 
used for the clicked units.

Please do not rewrite the whole component, instead write 3-4 blocks of code that
which implement the requested changes, and tell me the exact line numbers where they should be inserted.

===========================================================

Please update the ArrowChart.js component such that, 
it contains a toggle called show clicked/show all which 
allows the user between showing the arrows of all the units or only 
the arrows of the clicked units. 

To implement this, please update the block of code which begins at line 666, 
such that if the showClickedArrows state is true, only the arrows of the units in the clickedNodeIds array should be displayed.

Please do not rewrite the whole component, instead write re-implement the relevant 
blocks of code neccessary to implement the requested changes, and tell me the exact line numbers where they should be inserted.
