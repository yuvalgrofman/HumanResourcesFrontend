Consider the block of code which begins at line 853:

Please update the ParallelUnitCard-Style such that 
the border-width depends on the total number of soldiers in the unit.

There is no need to rewrite the entire code, just the 
relevant blocks of code that need to be changed.

==================================================================================================================

Please update the innerHTML code that begins in line 931 such that:
The total number of soldiers in a unit is displayed in thousands. 
For example, if there is a total of 1523 soldiers in a unit, it should be displayed as "1.5K"
and if there are 1782 soldiers in a unit, it should be displayed as "1.8K".  

Moreover, if there is less than 1000 soldiers in a unit, it should be displayed as is, without any formatting.
