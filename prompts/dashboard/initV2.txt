Consider a project project which is respoonsible for creating visual tools which help 
analyze Human Resources data in the IDF. 

The project has 5 main visualizations which are:

1. Chord Diagram - A visualization which is meant to show the movement of soldiers between units in the IDF. 

2. Group Chart - A visualization which shows an organizational chart where each movement between units 
is propogated to the parent units. The goal is to show masses of movements between larger parts of the organization.

3. Arrow Chart - A visualization which shows an organizational chart. Each movement between units is 
simply represented by an arrow between the two units.

4. Organization Chart - A visualization which shows an organizational chart without showing movements between units.
Each unit is represented by a card which contains three horiontal bars, which can track the change of three different types of soldiers 
in the unit over time. For example, we can track the amount of Talions, Psagot and Academic Soldiers exists in a unit over time.

5. Time Graph - A simple visualization which allows to place multiple units on a 
timeline and see how the amount of soldiers in each unit changes over time.

Please create a Dashboard page which is divided into 5 cards, where each card contains an image of the corresponding visualization
and a title. Moreover, the card should have a tooltop which contains a short description of the visualization.
Finally, clicking on the card should redirect to the corresponding visualization page.

To implement the clicks please take insparation from the given javascript component. 
Finally, I provide images for each visualization, which should be used in the cards,
they are located in the images folder. 
They have the following sizes:

Chord Diagram: 880 X 830
Group Chart: 1280 X 370
Arrow Chart: 1280 X 380
Organization Chart: 1280 X 390
Time Graph: 1280 X 380

When styling the page, please take inspiration from the given CSS file. 
Morover, make sure to make the page, clean, elegant, modern and responsive.
Feel free to create a dedicated CSS file for the Dashboard component and import it in the Dashboard component.
Do your best, Thank you!
