Consider the following ArrowChart.js component. 
This component is designed to render an organizational tree chart which represents the units in a organization.
Each unit which is represented as a node in the chart has a field called roles. 

The roles field is dictionary of the following form:

{
    'Type 1' : [soldier11ID, soldier12ID, ...],
    'Type 2' : [soldier21ID, soldier22ID, ...],
    'Type 3' : [soldier31ID, soldier32ID, ...],
}

These soldiers are special soldiers, and we are interested in tracking 
their movement across the organization, over time. 
Thus, your goal, is to modify the ArrowChart.js component to 
such that there exists arrows between nodes representing the movement of these soldiers. 

We provide the JS code for the ArrowChart.js component below
and the CSS code for the ArrowChart.css component.
Please add arrows between nodes to represent the movement of soldiers
while keeping the structure of the organizational tree chart the same.

======================================================================

Make the arrows shorter such that the end of the array is not covered by the card it is pointing to.
Moreover, make the color of the arrows represent the amount of soldiers moving between the nodes, 
and between two nodes there can be at most one arrow, which represents all the soldiers moving between those two nodes.

======================================================================

Please update the styling of the arrows such that the arrows always appear from the top-middle or bottom-middle 
of the card the are pointing from, and point to the right-middle or left-middle of the card they are pointing to.

=======================================================================

Now, please update each Node Card which represents a unit such that it 
also shows the overall difference in the number of special soldiers 
between the current time and the previous time step.
Please only rewrite the code that is necessary to achieve this,
and explain in detaul where to make the changes and what the should be.
