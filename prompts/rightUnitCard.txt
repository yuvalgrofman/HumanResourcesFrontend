Please create a React component called RightUnitCard. 
The Component receives two JSON objects of the following form:

amount = {
    "R1" : integer,
    "R2" : integer,
    "R3+" : integer,
}

1. The two JSON object are called currentAmount and lastAmount. They represnent the amount 
of the resources of each parameter, at the current and last time, respectively.

2. Minimum Value - The minimum value that can appear of some resource (Default is 0).
3. Maximum Value - The maximum value that can appear of some resource (Default is 50).

Using this information, the component uses the HorizontalBar component, which you created in the previous task,
and works as follows:

1. The component is a card which contains three horizontal bars, one for each resource (R1, R2, R3+).
2. The card contains a black outline and a white background. 
3. The card places the three horizontal bars in a vertical stack, 
where to the left of each bar is the name of the resource (R1, R2, R3+).
4. Above the top-most bar there appears the minimum and maximum values the card can take. 
In other words, above the left corner of the top-most bar, the minimum value is placed and above the right corner of the top-most bar,
the maximum value is placed.

To style this component, please use the given index.css file
and also create a dedicated CSS file for the RightUnitCard component.

Please do your best and thank you!
