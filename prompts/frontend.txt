A visualization tool for the human resources in different units in the army. 
To achieve this goal we want to build a website which contains two mains visual tools:
    1. An organizational chart which shows the different units in the army and the number of soldiers in each unit.
    2. A Time-based graph which shows the number of soldiers in a certain unit over time.

We want to create the framework for the website using React. 

We already have a backend which is implemented using FastAPI and uses a simple SQLite database to store the data. 
Please create a react project which communicates with the backend. 
We provide a file which contains the backend API.

Currently, only create a simple organizational chart 
and a time-based graph, to server as a template for the future development of the website.
The main focus is the framework of the website, general design and the communication with the backend.

A couple of notes about the design of the website:

1. The structure of the site should be as follows:
    A. Navigation Bar: The top of the page shoold contain a navigation bar with the following (from left to right):
        - A logo of the website (which server as a link to the home page) (left aligned)
        - Three links to the main pages of the website: (left aligned)
            - Dashboard Page (Homepage)
            - Organizational Chart Page (Org Chart)
            - Time-based Graph Page (Time Graph)
            - Unit details Page (Unit Details)
        
        - A search bar which allows the user to search for a unit in the website. (right aligned)
        - A date picker which allows the user to select a date. (right aligned)
    B. Control Panel: A left sidebar which differs between the different pages of the website. 
        It's goal is to provide the user a control over the main visualization of the page.
        The sidebar should contain the following:
        - A title of the sidebar (e.g. "Control Panel")
        - Different filter options which allows to control and create combinations of filters.
            - Possible filters: (Filter by number of regular soldiers, officers, senior officers and total amount of soldiers, unit name, parent unit)

    C. Main Visualization: This part appears in the center of the page and contains the main visualization of the page.
        The visualization should be responsive and should adapt to the size of the screen. 
        The visualization should be centered in the page and should have a small margin from the left and right sides of the page.
        The visualization should be interactive and allow the user to interact with it. 
        The user should be able to zoom in and out of the visualization, pan around it and click on different elements in the visualization.
        The user should be able to select a unit in the chart and see more details about it in the data panel (which is the right sidebar).
    
    D. Data Panel: The right sidebar's goal is to provide the user with more details about the selected unit in the chart.
        The data panel is divided into two visual elements: Top and Bottom.
        The top part of the data panel should present the distribution of the soldiers in the unit using a pie chart.
        The bottom part of the data panel should a time-based graph which shows the number of soldiers in the unit over time.
        The data panel should be responsive and should adapt to the size of the screen.
        Moreover, it should use a default time margin around the selected date.
        Make sure the the graphs in the data panel are simple and easy to understand,
        as they will be quite small. 
        Moreover, make sure the data panel does not take too much space from the main visualization.

When implementing the website, please make a modular design with division into folders and files.
Moreover, you can create an api.js file which contains the functions which communicate with the backend
and a DataContext.js file which contains the data context for the website.

For the visualizations you can use the D3.js library and the react-d3-library.

======================================================================================================================================

You forgot to add a Dashboard page to the website, which in practice is the homepage of the website. 
Please add a dashboard page to the website such that it is inviting and contains a natual flow to the rest of the pages of the website.
The homaepage should contain a title of the website, a short description of the website and buttons which refer to the different pages of the website.
It should have a simple and clean design and should be easy to navigate. 

======================================================================================================================================

Now, add a specific CSS design for each page of the website.
The design should be simple and clean, with a focus on usability and readability.
The design should use colors wisely to create a pleasant user experience
and to highlight important elements in the page.
For example, the pie-chart should use different a shade of colors for each slice of the pie-chart.
For example: Regular soldiers - light blue, Officers - blue, Senior officers - dark blue. 
Moreover, the useage of colors should be consistent across the website.
